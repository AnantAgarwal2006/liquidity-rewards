# Liquidity Rewards Move Smart Contract

## Description
The **Liquidity Rewards Move Smart Contract** is designed to incentivize liquidity providers by offering them fee discounts based on the duration of their liquidity contribution. The contract enables users to add liquidity and rewards them with fee reductions over time, promoting long-term engagement and stability in the ecosystem.

## Vision
The project aims to create a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for liquidity providers. By offering tiered fee reductions, the contract encourages users to commit liquidity for longer periods, fostering a stable and efficient financial environment. Our vision is to integrate this mechanism into larger decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, ensuring liquidity providers are fairly compensated for their contributions.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with DeFi Platforms:** Expand the contract's functionality to support multiple DeFi applications.
- **Enhanced Reward Mechanisms:** Introduce additional incentives such as governance tokens or interest-based rewards.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Enable liquidity provision using different crypto assets.
- **Automated Reward Distribution:** Develop automated distribution mechanisms to streamline the reward process.
